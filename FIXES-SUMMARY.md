# Wingo Casino - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### 1. User Registration & Login Issues
- **Problem**: Users were unable to register and login properly with "invalid credentials" errors
- **Solution**: Fixed password field mapping in auth controller to access `user.password_hash` instead of `user.password`
- **Result**: Users can now register and login successfully with persistent data

### 2. Data Persistence After Server Restart
- **Problem**: Users had to re-register after server restart (data was lost)
- **Solution**: Switched from in-memory database to persistent SQLite database stored in `database/casino.db`
- **Result**: User data persists after server restarts

### 3. Deposit/Withdrawal System with UPI Integration
- **Problem**: Users were getting money without payment in deposit popup
- **Solution**: Implemented proper UPI payment flow with admin approval system
- **Features Added**:
  - Deposit requests with UPI ID verification (9304511727@ybl)
  - Screenshot upload for payment proof
  - Admin approval workflow
  - Proper deposit/withdrawal history tracking
  - Status indicators (pending/approved/rejected)

### 4. Admin Panel Data Loading
- **Problem**: Admin panel showing "loading" instead of real-time data
- **Solution**: Fixed MySQL-specific SQL queries to work with SQLite
- **Result**: Admin panel now shows real-time user data, transaction history, and game statistics

### 5. Game Logic & Win/Loss Handling
- **Problem**: No instant payment for wins and deductions for losses
- **Solution**: Enhanced game logic with proper bet settlement
- **Features**:
  - Instant balance updates for wins
  - Automatic deduction for losses
  - Proper payout calculations (2x for big/small, 9x for number, 4.5x for violet)

### 6. Default Balance & Bonus Removal
- **Problem**: Users getting 1000rs bonus
- **Solution**: Set default balance to 0 (no bonus) during registration
- **Result**: New users start with ₹0.00 balance

### 7. Game Availability
- **Problem**: Some games showing "coming soon"
- **Solution**: All games are now fully functional with no "coming soon" placeholders

### 8. Transaction History
- **Problem**: No deposit/withdrawal history sections
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive transaction history with status tracking
- **Features**:
  - Deposit history with pending/success status
  - Withdrawal history with pending/completed status
